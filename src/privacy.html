      <p>PERFECT CLOUD NETWORK LLC. (“PERFECT CLOUD NETWORK,” “we,” “us,” “our”) maintains this Privacy Policy to inform you of our practices with regard to personal data we collect from or about you in connection with our web site (the “Site”) or through the provision of our services (the “Services”). We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material change by providing a notice on our web site or, if you are a customer, by whatever other means upon which we have mutually agreed. The current version of this Privacy Policy may be found at <a href="https://perfect-cloud.pro/privacy.html" >https://perfect-cloud.pro/privacy/</a>. By using the Site or the Services you acknowledge your consent to the practices described herein.</p>

        <li><p><strong>Personal data we collect</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Information you give us</strong></p>
              <p>In order for you to use our Services and other features of our
                Site, we will ask you for some of your personal data (e.g. contact information, name, etc.). The
                amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example,
                we ask visitors who would like to comment on our blog to provide a username. Those who purchase
                Services from us are asked to provide additional information including, as necessary, the personal
                and financial information required to process transactions. In each case, we collect such
                information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of your interaction
                with us. You can always refuse to supply personal data; however, doing so may prevent you from
                receiving our Services or engaging in other activities on the Site. In no event will we ever request
                sensitive personal data (e.g. health information, religious preferences, etc.) from you, and we
                expressly request that you not provide any such sensitive personal data to us.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Web server logs</strong></p>
              <p> As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically through your use
                of the Site. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet
                service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, the files viewed on the Site (e.g., HTML pages,
                graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data to analyze trends in the
                aggregate and administer the site. We use analytical software to help us understand this
                information. This software sends information to its licensor. Other sites and companies may also use
                this software. As a result, the licensor may collect information that, when aggregated by them,
                allows them to identify you individually. We have no responsibility for this collection and use.

            <li><p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
              <p>We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to analyze trends,
                administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, and gather demographic information
                about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.
                Ads appearing on our Site may be delivered to you by advertising partners who may set cookies. These
                cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
                advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information
                allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be
                of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies and does not cover the use of
                cookies by any advertisers. However, data tracking files used by us may also be used by these
                advertisers and, when combined with other information held by them, be used to identify you
                personally.</p>
